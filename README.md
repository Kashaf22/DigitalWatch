# DigitalWatch
Project Description and Purpose
This project revolves around the idea of creating a digital clock using the software and hardware knowledge we gained through this course. The digital clock should be track current time of the day in decimal hours, minutes, and second format. The rest of the functionality for the clock was dependent on the team choice therefore for our project as a team, we opted to display elapsed time to the user along with the current time. We also added enhancements to our project to meet points requirements. We opted to use keypad for user input to adjust current time to a desired value. Additionally, we decided to connect LCD display and 4 extra switches with 12C subsystem to show time.Three of the switches helped in starting, stoping and resetting the elapsed time and the last switch helped in activating the keypad for user input.
